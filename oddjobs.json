Because all of their APs are spent on HP, and because they gain access to Meso Guard in third job, blood bandits are virtually unkillable. However, naturally enough, their melee capabilities are typically very subpar, and they are more or less built around the use of Meso Explosion, which thankfully does not scale with any of the bandit’s stats, and also demands some tankiness to allow the bandit to get up close in order to place, and then explode, mesos."
