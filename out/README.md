# Odd jobs

Note that this list is inherently incomplete, because new odd jobs could
potentially be invented. Also note that the “Stat constraints”
reference *base* stats/abilities; that is, the stats themselves without any
bonuses from equipment or buffs.

The “Notable equipment” for each job intentionally excludes
equipment items that are not particularly unique to the job. For example, many
of the same weapons (those swords, axes, blunt weapons, spears, polearms, and
daggers that lack job requirements) are used by almost all melee-oriented odd
jobs (e.g. permabeginner) in common. As a result, unless these weapons are
useful for other reasons that are somewhat special to the job in question, they
are not listed under “Notable equipment”.

## Camper

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Training Camp

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- [Sword](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01302000)
- [Wooden Club](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01322005)
- [Hand Axe](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01312004)

### Notes

The camper experience varies significantly based on what version of the Training Camp they are subjected to. Later versions introduced a more clear “Training Camp” aesthetic, with custom-textured and custom-built maps, the “green apple suit” that the camper is forced to wear, and different mobs from the Jr. Sentinels of earlier versions.

Campers can only fight mobs that give 1 EXP each, making them extraordinarily time-consuming to train.

## Magelander

Also known as: “Wand Islander”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Maple Island

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX** | Secondary stats: INT, LUK

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

- [Amethyst Earrings](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01032003)

### Notes

Magelanders are defined by their use of the Metal Wand, a level 18 wand with no job requirements that drops from Red Snails. It requires 55 INT and 20 LUK to equip.

## Wand Beginner

Also known as: “Wand Perma”, “Wand Permabeginner”, “Permawander”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, INT, LUK

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- [Wooden Wand](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372005)

- [Heart Staff](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372031)
- [Heart Wand](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372033)

### Notes

Wand beginners can be thought of as both an off-island variant of the magelander, as well as a permabeginner variant of the wand warrior.

## Islander

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Maple Island

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- [Three Snails](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=0001000)

Notable equipment:

- [Sky Snowboard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01442012)
- [Double Axe](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01312000)
- [Leather Purse](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01322007)

- [White Gomushin](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01072004)
- [Amethyst Earrings](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01032003)

## Besinner

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **LUK**

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- [Magical Mitten](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01472063)

### Notes

Besinners are defined by their use of the Magical Mitten, a level 10 claw with no job requirements. There are sometimes other claws that can be used by beginners, but this will vary by implementation. Some implementations may not even have any claws usable by beginners — not even the Magical Mitten — and thus besinners are impossible in such implementations.

Depending on the implementation, besinners may only be able to throw Snowballs. They can possibly also throw arrows, and/or other throwing stars like Ilbis.

## Permabeginner

Also known as: “Permanoob”, “Perma”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- [Frozen Tuna [level 20]](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01442018)
- [Sake Bottle](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01422011)
- [Maroon Mop](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01442023)

## DEX Beginner

Also known as: “DEX Perma”, “DEX Permabeginner”, “Permadexer”, “Dexterity Beginner”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stats: **DEX**, **STR**

Stat constraints:

- STR = 4

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

### Notes

DEX beginners are essentially a variant of the ordinary permabeginner, in much the same way that the DEX warrior is a variant of the ordinary warrior.

DEX beginners do not have the accuracy issues that ordinary permabeginners have. Furthermore, their damage may be lower overall, but it is considerably more stable.

## Permawarrior

Also known as: “Perma-warrior”, “Permaswordman”, “Perma-swordman”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Attacks:

- [Power Strike](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001004)
- [Slash Blast](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001005)

Notable skills:

- [Improved MaxHP Increase](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1000001)

### Notes

Permawarriors are typically unconstrained (although they can, of course, be mixed with other odd jobs, e.g. DEX warrior), except that they cannot take second job advancement.

## HP Warrior

Also known as: “Blood Warrior”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin

Primary stat: **HP** | Secondary stats: STR, DEX

Stat constraints:

- STR = 35
- DEX = 4
- LUK = 4

Attacks:

- [Power Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101007)
- [Power Strike](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001004)
- [Slash Blast](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001005)

Notable skills:

- [Power Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101007)
- [Improved MaxHP Increase](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1000001)
- [Rage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101006)
- [Threaten](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1201006)
- [Armor Crash](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1111007)
- [Shout](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1111008)
- [Magic Crash](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1211009)

### Notes

After achieving 35 base STR (necessary for first job advancement), the HP warrior saves their AP until they have maxed out Improving MaxHP Increase, at which point all AP (and future AP) is spent on HP.

HP warriors deal damage primarily via Power Guard, and as such, typically want to lower their WDEF as much as possible in order to maximize this damage.

HP warriors are capable of defeating incredibly powerful bosses (e.g. Bigfoot) on their own at a low level, due to their obvious extreme tankiness and their ability to deal guaranteed damage with Power Guard.

## Wand Warrior

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin
- Beginner → Warrior → Spearman → Dragon Knight → Dark Knight

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX** | Secondary stats: LUK, INT

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- [Power Strike](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001004)
- [Slash Blast](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001005)
- [Power Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101007)
- [Dragon Roar](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1311006)

Notable skills:

- [Power Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101007)
- [Improved MaxHP Increase](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1000001)
- [Rage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101006)
- [Iron Will](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1301006)
- [Hyper Body](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1301007)
- [Threaten](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1201006)
- [Combo Attack](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1111002)
- [Armor Crash](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1111007)
- [Shout](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1111008)
- [Magic Crash](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1211009)
- [Dragon Roar](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1311006)
- [Power Crash](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1311007)

Notable equipment:

- [Wooden Wand](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372005)
- [Hardwood Wand](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372006)
- [Metal Wand](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372002)
- [Streetlight](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372017)
- [Heart Staff](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372031)
- [Heart Wand](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01372033)

### Notes

The only restriction placed on wand warriors is the reqirement that they exclusively use weapons that are wands (or staves, but there are generally no staves that are equippable by non-magicians). This turns out to be quite the downside, because this locks them out of most of their skills.

Wand warriors can be thought of as considerably weaker versions of dagger warriors, in some sense. The end-game weapon for the wand warrior is the Heart Wand (or Heart Staff, which is a confusingly-named wand), which they are already using by the time that they hit level 54.

### Notes

LUK warriors are actually very similar to LUK mages, in that they essentially play like their non-odd-job counterparts, albeit considerably weaker. LUK warriors are, again like LUK mages, somewhat limited in their equipment choices because of their unusual AP allocation, but can nevertheless use job-appropriate weapons that enable them to make use of all of their skills.

## Dagger Warrior

### Notes

The only restriction placed on dagger warriors is the reqirement that they exclusively use weapons that are daggers. This turns out to be quite the downside, because this locks them out of most of their skills.

Surprisingly, daggers that are exclusive to rogues and warriors actually progress all the way up to level 110, with the Dragon Kanzir!

### Notes

DEX warriors are essentially a stronger variant of LUK warriors, because DEX actually contributes somewhat (although not nearly as much as STR) to their damage, unlike LUK.

DEX warriors are also notable for their ability to easily equip the Stonetooth Sword, a level 100 warrior-only two-handed sword that requires at least 120 DEX (but only 0 STR) to equip. The Stonetooth Sword is a viable and sought-after endgame weapon even for normal warriors.

Also known as: “Dexterity Mage”, “DEX Magician”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop
- Beginner → Magician → I/L Wizard → I/L Mage → I/L Archmage
- Beginner → Magician → F/P Wizard → F/P Mage → F/P Archmage

### Notes

DEX mages are essentially a variant of the STR mage, in much the same way that the DEX warrior is a variant of the ordinary warrior.

DEX mages do not have the accuracy issues that STR mages have. Furthermore, their damage may be lower overall, but it is considerably more stable.

### Notes

Gishes attack both with melee (similarly to the closely related STR mage) and with spells.

Gishes use INT (unlike LUK mages) as their primary casting stat, but have this INT limited by their STR. INT gishes can still make good use of LUK, as it contributes to both their WACC and their MACC (and AVOID, for that matter). See the LUK gish for a variant that is more similar to LUK mages, but naturally somewhat weaker than this kind of gish.

## LUK Gish

### Notes

LUK gishes attack both with melee (similarly to the closely related STR mage) and with spells.

LUK gishes use LUK (unlike ordinary gishes) as their primary casting stat. See the gish for a variant that is generally somewhat stronger than the LUK gish.

Although being INTless is certainly a downside for LUK gishes when compared to their INT-based counterparts, LUK gishes suffer from fewer accuracy issues than their INT-based counterparts, due to their reasonably high LUK. Also, LUK gishes are less sensitive to their stat allocation than their INT-based counterparts, not only due to the relative lack of accuracy issues, but also because their magic damage (assuming that they don’t miss) is not sensitive to their LUK.

## LUK Mage

Also known as: “Magelet”, “LUK Magician”, “INTless Mage”, “INTless Magician”, “Pure LUK Mage”, “Pure LUK Magician”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop

### Notes

LUK mages play very similarly to ordinary mages, although obviously they are considerably weaker, and are also incapable of equipping items with significant INT requirements. LUK mages also, of course, have considerably higher AVOID.

### Notes

Bow-whackers do not have the stat constraint that woodsmen have, because they are disallowed from shooting projectiles, and disallowed from using Soul Arrow. They can only deal damage by whacking monsters with their (cross)bow.

### Notes

Grim reapers are characterised and defined by their exclusive use of the Scythe, a level 15 one-handed axe that requires its wielder to be a rogue and to have at least 35 LUK and 30 DEX.

### Notes

STR assassins cannot put any SP into Double Stab.

STR assassins are somewhat similar to brigands: they essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills. Later on, Flash Jump in particular is a highlight. However, STR assassins lack both Steal and Meso Explosion.

### Notes

Blood bandits are essentially ordinary bandits (in the sense that they can use daggers and stabbing skills, and thus all bandit/chief bandit/shadower skills) that trade off the large majority of their melee power in exchange for extreme tankiness. Because all of their APs are spent on HP, and because they gain access to Meso Guard in third job, blood bandits are virtually unkillable. However, naturally enough, their melee capabilities are typically very subpar, and they are more or less built around the use of Meso Explosion, which thankfully does not scale with any of the bandit’s stats, and also demands some tankiness to allow the bandit to get up close in order to place, and then explode, mesos.

## Brigand

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Bandit → Chief Bandit → Shadower

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, LUK

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25
- LUK = 4

- [Black Snowshoes](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01072171)

### Notes

Brigands cannot put any SP into stabbing skills, like Double Stab. Steal does not count as a “stabbing skill” for the purpose of this definition.

Brigands essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills, to boot. Later, brigands get access to a radically different attacking skill: Meso Explosion.

## Permapirate

Also known as: “Perma-pirate”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Pirate

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

### Notes

DEX brawlers are essentially the pirate version of DEX warriors, although they have a hard time getting equipped, due to the paucity of knucklers that lack stat requirements.

DEX brawlers actually have the highest AVOID in the game, due to the fact that brawlers/marauders/buccaneers gain a whopping 1.5 AVOID per point of DEX.

## Swashbuckler

Also known as: “STR Gunslinger”, “Strength Gunslinger”, “STR Slinger”, “STR Sair”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Pirate → Gunslinger → Outlaw → Corsair

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 20

- [Sommersault Kick](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=5001002)

- [Maple Gun](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01492020)
- [Maple Storm Pistol](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01492021)
- [Maple Canon Shooter](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01492022)
- [Purple Snowshoes](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01072338)

### Notes

Swashbucklers cannot put any SP into punching abilities. Being gunslingers, however, they could only have access to Flash Fist anyways.

Swashbucklers tend to be quite similar to woodsmen in their ability to effectively melee and to somewhat effectively range, but differ in their unique skillset, mobility, and ability to use Somersault Kick in melee.
