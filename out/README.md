# Odd jobs

## Permabeginner

Also known as: “Permanoob”, “Perma”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Frozen Tuna [level 20]

## Besinner

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **LUK**

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Magical Mitten

### Notes

Besinners are defined by their use of the Magical Mitten, a level 10 claw with no job requirements. There are sometimes other claws that can be used by beginners, but this will vary by implementation. Some implementations may not even have any claws usable by beginners — not even the Magical Mitten — and thus besinners are impossible in such implementations.

Depending on the implementation, besinners may only be able to throw Snowballs. They can possibly also throw arrows, and/or other throwing stars like Ilbis.

### Notes

## Camper

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Training Camp

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Sword

### Notes

The camper experience varies significantly based on what version of the Training Camp they are subjected to. Later versions introduced a more clear “Training Camp” aesthetic, with custom-textured and custom-built maps, the “green apple suit” that the camper is forced to wear, and different mobs from the Jr. Sentinels of earlier versions.

Campers can only fight mobs that give 1 EXP each, making them extraordinarily time-consuming to train.

## STR Mage

Also known as: “Strength Mage”, “Battle Mage”, “STR Magician”, “Gish”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop
- Beginner → Magician → I/L Wizard → I/L Mage → I/L Archmage

### Notes

STR mages largely play like “permabeginners, but with buffs”, although they can become more gish-like; particularly, with the use of weapons that give both WATK and MATK, and the use of magical skills that remain useful even with low INT, like Heal and Poison Mist.

## Woodsman

Also known as: “STR Archer”, “Strength Archer”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Archer → Hunter → Ranger → Bowmaster
- Beginner → Archer → Crossbowman → Sniper → Marksman

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25

Attacks:

- basic attack
- Double Shot
- Power Knock-Back
- Arrow Bomb

### Notes

Woodsmen come in more-or-less three varieties, owing to their versatility: bow/crossbow woodsmen, melee woodsmen, and bow-whacking woodsmen. The first of these is the most similar to a traditional bow or crossbow user, albeit naturally much weaker. Bow-whacking woodsmen rely on the Power Knock-Back skill, and are generally the weakest of the three.

The woodsman’s versatility can allow them to easily switch between ranged and melee combat.

## Brigand

Also known as: “STR Assassin”, “Strength Assassin”, “STR Sin”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Assassin → Hermit → Nightlord

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, LUK

Notable equipment:

- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe

### Notes

Brigands essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills, to boot.

## Swashbuckler

Also known as: “STR Gunslinger”, “Strength Gunslinger”, “STR Slinger”, “STR Sair”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Pirate → Gunslinger → Outlaw → Corsair

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

### Notes

Swashbucklers are disallowed from using knuckles, and as such, cannot make use of punching abilities. Being gunslingers, however, they could only have access to Flash Fist anyways.

Swashbucklers tend to be quite similar to woodsmen in their ability to effectively melee and to somewhat effectively range, but differ in their unique skillset, mobility, and ability to use Somersault Kick in melee.

## HP Warrior

Also known as: “Blood Warrior”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin

Primary stat: **HP** | Secondary stats: STR, DEX

Stat constraints:

- STR = 35
- DEX = 4

Attacks:

- Power Guard
- Power Strike
- Slash Blast

Notable skills:

- Power Guard
- Improved MaxHP Increase
- Rage
- Armor Crash
- Shout
- Magic Crash

### Notes

After achieving 35 base STR (necessary for first job advancement), the HP Warrior saves their AP until they have maxed out Improving Max HP Increase, at which point all AP (and future AP) is spent on HP.

HP Warriors deal damage primarily via Power Guard, and as such typically want to lower their WDEF as much as possible in order to maximize this damage.
