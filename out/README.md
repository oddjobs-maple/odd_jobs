# Odd jobs

## Camper

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Training Camp

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Sword

### Notes

The camper experience varies significantly based on what version of the Training Camp they are subjected to. Later versions introduced a more clear “Training Camp” aesthetic, with custom-textured and custom-built maps, the “green apple suit” that the camper is forced to wear, and different mobs from the Jr. Sentinels of earlier versions.

Campers can only fight mobs that give 1 EXP each, making them extraordinarily time-consuming to train.

## Magelander

Also known as: “Wand Islander”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Maple Island

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX** | Secondary stats: INT, LUK

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Metal Wand
- Ice Jeans
- Blue One-lined T-Shirt [M]
- Red-Striped T-Shirt [F]
- White Gomushin
- Amethyst Earrings

### Notes

Magelanders are defined by their use of the Metal Wand, a level 18 wand with no job requirements that drops from Red Snails. It requires 55 INT and 20 LUK to equip.

## Islander

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Maple Island

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX** | Secondary stat: LUK

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Leather Purse

- White Gomushin
- Amethyst Earrings

## Besinner

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **LUK**

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

- Magical Mitten

### Notes

Besinners are defined by their use of the Magical Mitten, a level 10 claw with no job requirements. There are sometimes other claws that can be used by beginners, but this will vary by implementation. Some implementations may not even have any claws usable by beginners — not even the Magical Mitten — and thus besinners are impossible in such implementations.

Depending on the implementation, besinners may only be able to throw Snowballs. They can possibly also throw arrows, and/or other throwing stars like Ilbis.

## Permabeginner

Also known as: “Permanoob”, “Perma”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable equipment:

## HP Warrior

Also known as: “Blood Warrior”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin

Primary stat: **HP** | Secondary stats: STR, DEX

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 4

Attacks:

- Power Guard
- Power Strike
- Slash Blast

Notable skills:

- Power Guard
- Improved MaxHP Increase
- Rage
- Armor Crash
- Shout
- Magic Crash

### Notes

After achieving 35 base STR (necessary for first job advancement), the HP Warrior saves their AP until they have maxed out Improving MaxHP Increase, at which point all AP (and future AP) is spent on HP.

HP Warriors deal damage primarily via Power Guard, and as such, typically want to lower their WDEF as much as possible in order to maximize this damage.

## STR Mage

Also known as: “Strength Mage”, “Battle Mage”, “STR Magician”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop
- Beginner → Magician → I/L Wizard → I/L Mage → I/L Archmage

### Notes

STR mages largely play like “permabeginners, but with buffs”, although they can also have other utility skills, like Heal. For a more magically-oriented magician that still engages in melee, see the gish (and the LUK gish).

### Notes

Gishes attack both with melee (similarly to the closely related STR mage) and with spells.

Gishes use INT (unlike LUK mages) as their primary casting stat, but have this INT limited by their STR. See the LUK gish for a variant that is more similar to LUK mages, but naturally weaker than this kind of gish.

## LUK Gish

Also known as: “LUK Mixed Attacker Mage”, “LUK Mixed Attacker”, “LUK Hybrid Mage”, “LUK Hybrid Magician”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop
- Beginner → Magician → I/L Wizard → I/L Mage → I/L Archmage
- Beginner → Magician → F/P Wizard → F/P Mage → F/P Archmage

Primary stats: **STR**, **LUK** | Secondary stats: DEX, INT

Stat constraints:

- INT = 20

Attacks:

- basic attack

### Notes

LUK gishes attack both with melee (similarly to the closely related STR mage) and with spells.

LUK gishes use LUK (unlike ordinary gishes) as their primary casting stat. See the gish for a variant that is generally stronger than the LUK gish.

## Woodsman

Also known as: “STR Archer”, “Strength Archer”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Archer → Hunter → Ranger → Bowmaster
- Beginner → Archer → Crossbowman → Sniper → Marksman

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25

Attacks:

- basic attack
- Double Shot
- Power Knock-Back
- Arrow Bomb
- Strafe
- Inferno
- Arrow Rain
- Blizzard
- Arrow Eruption

Notable skills:

- The Blessing of Amazon
- Focus
- Critical Shot
- Puppet
- Blizzard

Notable equipment:

- War Bow
- Maple Bow
- Maple Soul Searcher
- Maple Kandiva Bow
- Bow of Magical Destruction
- Crossbow
- Maple Crow
- Maple Crossbow
- Maple Nishada
- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe
- Wooden Mallet
- Monkey Wrench
- Green Snowshoes

### Notes

Woodsmen come in more-or-less three varieties, owing to their versatility: bow/crossbow woodsmen, melee woodsmen, and bow-whacking woodsmen. The first of these is the most similar to a traditional bow or crossbow user, albeit naturally much weaker. Bow-whacking woodsmen rely on the Power Knock-Back skill, and are generally the weakest of the three.

The woodsman’s versatility can allow them to easily switch between ranged and melee combat.

## STR Assassin

Also known as: “STR Sin”, “Strength Assassin”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Assassin → Hermit → Nightlord

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, LUK

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25
- LUK = 4

Attacks:

- basic attack

Notable skills:

- Nimble Body
- Disorder
- Dark Sight
- Haste
- Flash Jump
- Alchemist

Notable equipment:

- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe
- Wooden Mallet
- Monkey Wrench
- Maple Thief Shield
- Black Snowshoes

### Notes

STR assassins cannot put any SP into Double Stab.

STR assassins are somewhat similar to brigands: they essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills. Later on, Flash Jump in particular is a highlight. However, STR assassins lack both Steal and Meso Explosion.

## Brigand

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Bandit → Chief Bandit → Shadower

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, LUK

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25
- LUK = 4

Attacks:

- basic attack
- Steal
- Meso Explosion

Notable skills:

- Nimble Body
- Disorder
- Dark Sight
- Steal
- Haste
- Shield Mastery
- Meso Guard

Notable equipment:

- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe
- Wooden Mallet
- Monkey Wrench
- Maple Thief Shield
- Black Snowshoes

### Notes

Brigands cannot put any SP into stabbing skills, like Double Stab. Steal does not count as a “stabbing skill” for the purpose of this definition.

Brigands essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills, to boot. Later, brigands get access to a radically different attacking skill: Meso Explosion.

## Swashbuckler

Also known as: “STR Gunslinger”, “Strength Gunslinger”, “STR Slinger”, “STR Sair”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Pirate → Gunslinger → Outlaw → Corsair

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 20

Attacks:

- Sommersault Kick
- Double Shot
- Grenade
- Invisible Shot
- Ice Splitter

Notable skills:

- Bullet Time
- Blank Shot
- Wings
- Recoil Shot
- Octopus
- Gaviota
- Homing Beacon

Notable equipment:

- Pistol
- Maple Gun
- Maple Storm Pistol
- Maple Canon Shooter
- Purple Snowshoes

### Notes

Swashbucklers are disallowed from using knuckles, and as such, cannot make use of punching abilities. Being gunslingers, however, they could only have access to Flash Fist anyways.

Swashbucklers tend to be quite similar to woodsmen in their ability to effectively melee and to somewhat effectively range, but differ in their unique skillset, mobility, and ability to use Somersault Kick in melee.
