# Odd jobs

Note that this list is inherently incomplete, because new odd jobs could
potentially be invented. Also note that the “Stat constraints”
reference *base* stats/abilities; that is, the stats themselves without any
bonuses from equipment or buffs.

The “Notable equipment” for each job intentionally excludes
equipment items that are not particularly unique to the job. For example, many
of the same weapons (those swords, axes, blunt weapons, spears, polearms, and
daggers that lack job requirements) are used by almost all melee-oriented odd
jobs (e.g. permabeginner) in common. As a result, unless these weapons are
useful for other reasons that are somewhat special to the job in question, they
are not listed under “Notable equipment”.

## Camper

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Training Camp

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- Sword
- Wooden Club
- Hand Axe

### Notes

The camper experience varies significantly based on what version of the Training Camp they are subjected to. Later versions introduced a more clear “Training Camp” aesthetic, with custom-textured and custom-built maps, the “green apple suit” that the camper is forced to wear, and different mobs from the Jr. Sentinels of earlier versions.

Campers can only fight mobs that give 1 EXP each, making them extraordinarily time-consuming to train.

## Magelander

Also known as: “Wand Islander”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Maple Island

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX** | Secondary stats: INT, LUK

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Three Snails

Notable equipment:

- Metal Wand
- Ice Jeans
- Blue One-lined T-Shirt [M]
- Red-Striped T-Shirt [F]
- White Gomushin
- Amethyst Earrings

### Notes

Magelanders are defined by their use of the Metal Wand, a level 18 wand with no job requirements that drops from Red Snails. It requires 55 INT and 20 LUK to equip.

## Islander

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Location: Maple Island

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX** | Secondary stat: LUK

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- Leather Purse
- Ice Jeans
- Blue One-lined T-Shirt [M]
- Red-Striped T-Shirt [F]
- White Gomushin
- Amethyst Earrings

## Besinner

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **LUK**

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- Magical Mitten

### Notes

Besinners are defined by their use of the Magical Mitten, a level 10 claw with no job requirements. There are sometimes other claws that can be used by beginners, but this will vary by implementation. Some implementations may not even have any claws usable by beginners — not even the Magical Mitten — and thus besinners are impossible in such implementations.

Depending on the implementation, besinners may only be able to throw Snowballs. They can possibly also throw arrows, and/or other throwing stars like Ilbis.

## Permabeginner

Also known as: “Permanoob”, “Perma”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable equipment:

- Frozen Tuna [level 20]
- Sake Bottle
- Maroon Mop

## HP Warrior

Also known as: “Blood Warrior”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin

Primary stat: **HP** | Secondary stats: STR, DEX

Stat constraints:

- STR = 35
- DEX = 4
- LUK = 4

Attacks:

- Power Guard
- Power Strike
- Slash Blast

Notable skills:

- Power Guard
- Improved MaxHP Increase
- Rage
- Threaten
- Armor Crash
- Shout
- Magic Crash

### Notes

After achieving 35 base STR (necessary for first job advancement), the HP Warrior saves their AP until they have maxed out Improving MaxHP Increase, at which point all AP (and future AP) is spent on HP.

HP Warriors deal damage primarily via Power Guard, and as such, typically want to lower their WDEF as much as possible in order to maximize this damage.

## LUK Warrior

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin
- Beginner → Warrior → Spearman → Dragon Knight → Dark Knight

Primary stats: **LUK**, **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Stat constraints:

- Maple Soul Rohen
- Maple Demon Axe
- Maple Havoc Hammer
- Maple Belzet
- Maple Soul Spear
- Maple Karstan
- Daiwa Sword

### Notes

LUK warriors are actually very similar to LUK mages, in that they essentially play like their non-odd-job counterparts, albeit considerably weaker. LUK warriors are, again like LUK mages, somewhat limited in their equipment choices because of their unusual AP allocation, but can nevertheless use job-appropriate weapons that enable them to make use of all of their skills.

## Dagger Warrior

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin
- Beginner → Warrior → Spearman → Dragon Knight → Dark Knight

Primary stats: **STR**, **DEX**

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Power Strike
- Slash Blast
- Power Guard
- Dragon Roar

Notable skills:

- Power Guard
- Improved MaxHP Increase
- Rage
- Iron Will
- Hyper Body
- Threaten
- Combo Attack
- Armor Crash
- Shout
- Magic Crash
- Dragon Roar
- Power Crash

Notable equipment:

- Fruit Knife
- Christmas Tree
- Field Dagger
- Coconut Knife
- Iron Dagger
- Cass
- Korean Fan
- Plastic Bottle
- Sai
- Liu Bei Dagger
- Serpent’s Coil
- Fan
- Kebob
- Angelic Betrayal
- Cursayer
- Gold Double Knife

### Notes

The only restriction placed on dagger warriors is the reqirement that they exclusively use weapons that are daggers. This turns out to be quite the downside, because this locks them out of most of their skills.

Surprisingly, daggers that are exclusive to rogues and warriors actually progress all the way up to level 100, with the Gold Double Knife!

## DEX Warrior

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Warrior → Fighter → Crusader → Hero
- Beginner → Warrior → Page → White Knight → Paladin
- Beginner → Warrior → Spearman → Dragon Knight → Dark Knight

Primary stats: **DEX**, **STR** | Secondary stat: LUK

Stat constraints:

- STR = 35

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Power Strike
- Slash Blast
- Power Guard
- Panic: Sword
- Panic: Axe
- Coma: Sword
- Coma: Axe
- Charged Blow
- Spear Crusher
- Pole Arm Crusher
- Dragon Fury: Spear
- Dragon Fury: Pole Arm
- Dragon Roar

Notable skills:

- Power Guard
- Improved MaxHP Increase
- Rage
- Iron Will
- Hyper Body
- Threaten
- Combo Attack
- Armor Crash
- Shout
- Fire Charge: Sword
- Flame Charge: BW
- Ice Charge: Sword
- Blizzard Charge: BW
- Thunder Charge: Sword
- Lightning Charge: BW
- Magic Crash
- Dragon Roar
- Power Crash

Notable equipment:

- Metal Axe
- Wooden Sword
- Wooden Mallet
- Spear
- Pole Arm
- Field Dagger
- Maple Dragon Axe
- Maple Doom Singer
- Maple Impaler
- Maple Scorpio
- Trumpet
- Maple Glory Sword
- Maple Steel Axe
- Maple Soul Rohen
- Maple Demon Axe
- Maple Havoc Hammer
- Maple Belzet
- Maple Soul Spear
- Maple Karstan
- Daiwa Sword
- Stonetooth Sword

### Notes

DEX warriors are essentially a stronger variant of LUK warriors, because DEX actually contributes somewhat (although not nearly as much as STR) to their damage, unlike LUK.

DEX warriors are also notable for their ability to easily equip the Stonetooth Sword, a level 100 warrior-only two-handed sword that requires at least 120 DEX (but only 0 STR) to equip. The Stonetooth Sword is a viable and sought-after endgame weapon even for normal warriors.

## STR Mage

Also known as: “Strength Mage”, “Battle Mage”, “STR Magician”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop
- Beginner → Magician → I/L Wizard → I/L Mage → I/L Archmage
- Beginner → Magician → F/P Wizard → F/P Mage → F/P Archmage

### Notes

STR mages largely play like “permabeginners, but with buffs”, although they can also have other utility skills, like Heal. For a more magically-oriented magician that still engages in melee, see the gish (and the LUK gish).

## Gish

Also known as: “INT Gish”, “Mixed Attacker Mage”, “Mixed Attacker”, “Hybrid Mage”, “Hybrid Magician”

Possible job progressions:

### Notes

Gishes attack both with melee (similarly to the closely related STR mage) and with spells.

Gishes use INT (unlike LUK mages) as their primary casting stat, but have this INT limited by their STR. See the LUK gish for a variant that is more similar to LUK mages, but naturally weaker than this kind of gish.

## LUK Gish

Also known as: “LUK Mixed Attacker Mage”, “LUK Mixed Attacker”, “LUK Hybrid Mage”, “LUK Hybrid Magician”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Magician → Cleric → Priest → Bishop

### Notes

LUK gishes attack both with melee (similarly to the closely related STR mage) and with spells.

LUK gishes use LUK (unlike ordinary gishes) as their primary casting stat. See the gish for a variant that is generally stronger than the LUK gish.

### Notes

LUK mages play very similarly to ordinary mages, although obviously they are considerably weaker, and are also incapable of equipping items with significant INT requirements.

## Woodsman

Also known as: “STR Archer”, “Strength Archer”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Archer → Hunter → Ranger → Bowmaster
- Beginner → Archer → Crossbowman → Sniper → Marksman

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Double Shot
- Arrow Bomb
- Iron Arrow: Crossbow
- Power Knock-Back
- Strafe
- Inferno
- Arrow Rain

- Crossbow
- Maple Crow
- Maple Crossbow
- Maple Nishada
- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe
- Wooden Mallet
- Monkey Wrench
- Green Snowshoes

### Notes

The woodsman’s versatility can allow them to switch between ranged and melee physical combat.

## Bow-whacker

Also known as: “Crossbow-whacker”, “Bow-whacking Woodsman”, “Crossbow-whacking Woodsman”, “Knockback Archer”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Archer → Hunter → Ranger → Bowmaster
- Beginner → Archer → Crossbowman → Sniper → Marksman

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Power Knock-Back

Notable skills:

- The Blessing of Amazon
- Focus
- Puppet

Notable equipment:

- War Bow
- Maple Bow
- Maple Soul Searcher
- Maple Kandiva Bow
- Bow of Magical Destruction
- Crossbow
- Maple Crow
- Maple Crossbow
- Maple Nishada
- Green Snowshoes

### Notes

Bow-whackers do not have the stat constraint that woodsmen have, because they are disallowed from shooting projectiles, and disallowed from using Soul Arrow. They can only deal damage by whacking monsters with their (cross)bow.

## STR Assassin

Also known as: “STR Sin”, “Strength Assassin”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Assassin → Hermit → Nightlord

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, LUK

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25
- LUK = 4

Attacks:

- [basic attack]

Notable skills:

- Nimble Body
- Disorder
- Dark Sight
- Haste
- Flash Jump
- Alchemist
- Meso Up

Notable equipment:

- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe
- Wooden Mallet
- Monkey Wrench
- Maple Thief Shield
- Black Snowshoes

### Notes

STR assassins cannot put any SP into Double Stab.

STR assassins are somewhat similar to brigands: they essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills. Later on, Flash Jump in particular is a highlight. However, STR assassins lack both Steal and Meso Explosion.

## Blood Bandit

Also known as: “Blood Dit”, “HP Bandit”, “HP Dit”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Bandit → Chief Bandit → Shadower

Primary stat: **HP** | Secondary stats: LUK, DEX, STR

- DEX = 25
- LUK = 4
- STR = 4

Attacks:

- Meso Explosion
- [basic attack]
- Double Stab
- Savage Blow
- Steal
- Band of Thieves
- Assaulter

Notable skills:

- Meso Guard
- Nimble Body
- Disorder
- Dark Sight
- Steal
- Haste
- Shield Mastery

Notable equipment:

- Fruit Knife
- Christmas Tree
- Korean Fan
- Plastic Bottle
- Maple Wagner
- Liu Bei Dagger
- Maple Asura Dagger
- Maple Dark Mate
- Kebob
- Maple Thief Shield
- Black Snowshoes

### Notes

Blood bandits are essentially ordinary bandits (in the sense that they can use daggers and stabbing skills, and thus all bandit/chief bandit/shadower skills) that trade off the large majority of their melee power in exchange for extreme tankiness. Because all of their APs are spent on HP, and because they gain access to Meso Guard in third job, blood bandits are virtually unkillable. However, naturally enough, their melee capabilities are typically very subpar, and they are more or less built around the use of Meso Explosion, which thankfully does not scale with any of the bandit’s stats, and also demands some tankiness to allow the bandit to get up close in order to place, and then explode, mesos.

## Brigand

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Rogue → Bandit → Chief Bandit → Shadower

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stats: DEX, LUK

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 25
- LUK = 4

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Steal
- Meso Explosion

Notable skills:

- Nimble Body
- Disorder
- Dark Sight
- Steal
- Haste
- Meso Guard
- Shield Mastery

Notable equipment:

- Wooden Sword
- Metal Axe
- Wooden Mallet
- Monkey Wrench
- Maple Wagner
- Maple Asura Dagger
- Maple Dark Mate
- Maple Thief Shield
- Black Snowshoes

### Notes

Brigands cannot put any SP into stabbing skills, like Double Stab. Steal does not count as a “stabbing skill” for the purpose of this definition.

Brigands essentially play like more mobile permabeginners, with some neato utility skills, to boot. Later, brigands get access to a radically different attacking skill: Meso Explosion.

## LUK Bucc

Also known as: “Lucc Bucc”, “LUK Brawler”, “LUK Marauder”, “LUK Buccaneer”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Pirate → Brawler → Marauder → Buccaneer

Primary stats: **LUK**, **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Stat constraints:

- STR = 4
- DEX = 20

Attacks:

- [basic attack]
- Sommersault Kick
- Flash Fist
- Corkscrew Blow
- Backspin Blow
- Double Uppercut
- Shockwave
- Energy Drain
- Energy Blast

Notable skills:

- Bullet Time
- Improve MaxHP
- Oak Barrel
- Corkscrew Blow
- Backspin Blow
- Double Uppercut
- Transformation
- Stun Mastery
- Energy Charge
- Energy Drain

Notable equipment:

- Steel Knuckler
- Maple Knuckle
- Maple Storm Finger
- Maple Golden Claw
- Purple Snowshoes

### Notes

LUK buccs are essentially the pirate version of LUK warriors, although they have a hard time getting equipped, due to the paucity of knucklers that lack stat requirements.

## Swashbuckler

Also known as: “STR Gunslinger”, “Strength Gunslinger”, “STR Slinger”, “STR Sair”

Possible job progressions:

- Beginner → Pirate → Gunslinger → Outlaw → Corsair

Primary stat: **STR** | Secondary stat: DEX

Stat constraints:

- DEX = 20

Attacks:

- Sommersault Kick
- Double Shot
- Grenade
- Invisible Shot
- Ice Splitter

Notable skills:

- Bullet Time
- Blank Shot
- Wings
- Recoil Shot
- Octopus
- Gaviota
- Homing Beacon

Notable equipment:

- Pistol
- Maple Gun
- Maple Storm Pistol
- Maple Canon Shooter
- Purple Snowshoes

### Notes

Swashbucklers cannot put any SP into punching abilities. Being gunslingers, however, they could only have access to Flash Fist anyways.

Swashbucklers tend to be quite similar to woodsmen in their ability to effectively melee and to somewhat effectively range, but differ in their unique skillset, mobility, and ability to use Somersault Kick in melee.
